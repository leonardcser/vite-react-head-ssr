- Do not import `React` if it is not used in tsx files. `React` is already imported implicitly
- `react-router-dom` is depricated instead use `react-router` (v7) for imports
- Use kebab file names for all ts/tsx files
- For styling use tailwindcss v4
- Use pnpm not npm. (see [package.json](mdc:package.json))
- When removing code, DO NOT leave it commened out, instead delete the lines, not commented out code
